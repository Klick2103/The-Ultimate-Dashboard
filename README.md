# The-Ultimate-Dashboard

I started making this dashboard by devoting a few hours daily on Oct 22 and finally finished on Dec 22.
This dashboard has been made with the integration of VBA, Power Automate & Power query.
Following are the areas where the above tools are used:
1. VBA - Uploading reports on Onedrive
2. Power Query - Refreshing database by connecting to Onedrive
3. Power automate - Picking files from Outlook and putting the same on Onedrive & Sending the emails automatically.

I have made a detailed video covering the entire process.
